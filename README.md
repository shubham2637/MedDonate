# MedDonate
	 Medical Donation DataBase Management System is based on the concept of of helping poor people with medicines which they can’t afford. <br> Most of the time we have observed that people are left with medicines which remain unused.<br> These medicines are eventually thrown into the dustbin. <br> As we know life is so important and not all people can afford heavy expenditure, the idea of Medical Donation DataBase Management System came into picture.
<br> Medical Donation DataBase Management System allows people to donate unused medicines.
<br> Further these medicines will be transported to a medicine acceptor centre which will send medicines to hospitals where people who can’t afford medicines can get it for free.
